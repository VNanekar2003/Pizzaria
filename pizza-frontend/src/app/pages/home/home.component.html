      We believe in good. We launched Fresh Pan Pizza Best Excuse Awards on our Facebook fan page.
      Fans were given situations where they had to come up with wacky and fun excuses.
      The person with the best excuse won the Best Excuse Badge and won Pizzeria’s vouchers.
      Their enthusiastic response proved that Pizzeria’s Fresh Pan Pizza is the Tastiest Pan Pizza. Ever!

      Ever since we launched the Tastiest Pan Pizza, people have not been able to resist the softest,
      cheesiest, crunchiest, butteriest Fresh Pan Pizza.

        We're ruthless about goodness. We have no qualms about tearing up a day-old lettuce leaf
        or steaming a baby carrot. Cut. Chop. Steam. Stir. While they’re still young and fresh —
        that’s our motto.

        They make sauces sing and salads dance. They create magic with skill, knowledge,
        passion and stirring spoons. We send that goodness straight to you.
